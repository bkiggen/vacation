          <h2 class="panel-title">Mae Hong Motorbike Route</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Begin the trip in the northern Thailand tourist hub of Chiang Mai. From here riders can choose to travel the Mae Hong Son loop in a clockwise direction by heading south from Chiang Mai towards Hot along route 108 (an ideal choice if you're still building confidence as a rider), or anticlockwise via the more challenging route 107 north to Chiang Dao – you won’t miss a thing either way. The loop can be completed in a minimum of four days, but the more time you have, the better.</p>

          <h4>Chiang Mai – Chiang Dao – Pai (205km)</h4>

          <p>This magnificent stretch of road north of Mae Rim really sets the scene for this journey. Although many riders taking the north route head straight to Pai, the 80km deviation to Chiang Dao, a sleepy town nestled amongst a ring of vast limestone cliffs, is well worth the effort. The tarmac on this stretch, which winds its way through open expanses of verdant farmland and dusty towns, to sky-high gorges and vine-covered rocky outcrops, is in great condition, which is helpful if you’re still getting used to being on a bike.</p>

          <p>One of the main highlights of Chiang Dao, known as the ‘City of the Stars’, is the awe-inspiring cave complex about 5km out of town. It has more than 12km of stalactite-strewn tunnels to wander through. Some you can explore on your own, while others need a guide and a lantern (100B/pp). The town itself feels forgotten, and receives little in the way of tourism, yet there are some decent cafés and guesthouses within the vicinity.</p>

          <p>The turnoff to Pai and route 1095 is where the real bikers’ paradise begins – 762 bends wind their way through the steep mountain trails, over hills and through river valleys. The curves are tight and often slippery or gravel-strewn, so take it slow. The descent into Pai itself – through paddy fields so green they almost glow – is wonderful. There are loads of places to eat, drink and sleep here – Sabai Garden Bungalows (8 Th Wiang Tai) on the outskirts is a good option. If you’ve got a spare day or two up your sleeve you won't have any trouble whiling them away at Edible Jazz, eating Tom yum soup and drinking strong cocktails at sundown.</p>

        <p>Tucked into Thailand’s northwest corner, Mae Hong Son province is one of the nation’s last frontiers for off-the-beaten-track exploration. There’s no better way to take in its mountainous, mist covered passes and steamy jungles than tackling the 600km Mae Hong Son Loop by motorbike.</p>
